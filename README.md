- 🚀 Passionate Software & ML Engineer building scalable, AI-powered web apps that drive real-world impact.

- 🎓 Currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Southern California (GPA: 3.78/4.0).

- 🧠 My work combines full-stack development (React, TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) with machine learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch) to solve complex problems and streamline user experiences.

- 💼 Currently @ NailedIT Labs (Beauty-Tech):

  Integrating AI-based recommendation/classification models into a React marketplace
  Architecting backend services with FastAPI + PostgreSQL
  Automating CI/CD using GitHub Actions

- 🧪 Research @ USC:

  Built and optimized a ResNet50 model for diabetic retinopathy detection, enhancing disease recall by 30%
  Used advanced image preprocessing and dynamic class weighting
  
- 🧠 I also work on:

  Cloud-native deployments using Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
  MLOps workflows with automated pipelines
  Deep learning projects in computer vision and medical AI

- 📌 Recent Projects:

🧾 Secure EHR Audit Logging System with Chatbot: Encrypted logs + GPT chatbot for hospital systems
🗑 Waste Classification System: Transfer learning + Keras for 9 waste categories
🌱 Okra Disease Detection: Semantic segmentation with U-Net + ResNet18

- 📚 Publications:

🩺 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection with Inception V3 – 97.66% accuracy
🌿 Cotton & Okra Plant Disease Detection using CNN/U-Net
👥 Human–Computer Interaction prototype evaluation
